### Links

- Solution URL: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

white-space: pre; used with span as a marker for the text you want to span across multiple lines.

@media (min-width: 375px) { ... } : used to determine the minimum width of the browser screen used to provide certain css effects at a predetermined width.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.figure-caption.paragraf span {
  white-space: pre;
}

@media (min-width: 375px) {
  .figure {
    width: 350px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Maybe in the future i will change the image with QR code that contain my portfolio website link, so that everyone can access my website like portfolio or my projects much more easier.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this bootstrap and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
